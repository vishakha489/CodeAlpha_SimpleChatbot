# 🤖 Simple Rule-Based Chatbot (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly **rule-based chatbot** built using Python.  
The chatbot responds to specific user inputs and continues the conversation until the user types `"bye"`, `"exit"`, or `"quit"`.

## 🔹 Features
- Responds to basic greetings like **hello**
- Handles simple conversation such as:
  - "how are you"
  - "i am fine"
  - "what is your name"
- Recognizes exit commands (**bye**, **exit**, **quit**)
- Uses basic Python concepts:  
  ✔ while loop  
  ✔ if-else statements  
  ✔ strings  
  ✔ user input  

## 🔹 How It Works
The chatbot continuously takes input from the user and compares it with predefined rules.  
If the input matches a known phrase, the bot replies accordingly; otherwise, it sends a default "I didn’t understand" message

🔹 How to Run

1. Install Python (if not installed)

2. Save the code in a file like simplechatbot.py

3. Run the script using:

4. python simplechatbot.py
